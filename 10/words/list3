Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which then communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one other.[1] The components interact with one other in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics[why?] of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.
A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs).[2] There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.
Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers,[4] which communicate with each other via message passing.
